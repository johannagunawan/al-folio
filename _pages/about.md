Hi! I'm Johanna, a PhD student at Northeastern University. Before that, I was wrote docs for [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/) and [Akamai Technologies](https://www.akamai.com/). 

My research is firmly interdisciplinary, spanning privacy, consumer protections, law, and policy. I'm incredibly lucky to be advised by David Choffnes, Woodrow Hartzog, Alan Mislove, and Christo Wilson. 

Outside of research, I'm busy chasing after two dope cats, trying (and failing) new recipes, and deep-diving into weird topics (ask me about the 1996 Mt. Everest disaster).
